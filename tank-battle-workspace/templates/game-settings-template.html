    <h1>About this Game</h1>
    <p>
      This is a simple tank shooting game, implemented in the Dart
      programming language and designed to be played by multiple players
      around a single keyboard. The source code is available at <a
        href="https://github.com/AaronJRubin/dart-tank-battle">my github</a>.
    </p>
    <p>The controls were designed to minimize the amount of keys
      that would need to be processed simultaneously. No more than two
      keys should be pressed at the same time per player! This concern
      motivated my decision to make shooting automatic, rather than
      player-controlled.</p>
    <p>Most keyboards only allow for up to six key-presses to be
      registered at once. Consequently, playing this game with four
      players, which would require up to eight simultaneous key-presses,
      is not recommended unless you have a very high-end keyboard.</p>
    <p>It should also be noted that transparency (needed for
      particle effects like those in the Nine Pillar Lightning Stage)
      does not always work as it should, depending upon a variety of
      WebGL performance-related factors that are outside of the
      programmer's control. Details about this issue are discussed in
      the README at the github repository. Here, let it suffice to say
      that if you encounter some troubles with invisible obstacles in
      the Nine Pillar Lightning Stage, this is the reason! Depending
      upon your computer's GPU, however, you may not have any troubles
      at all.
    <p>While the actual models used in this game were created by me
      from geometric primitives (spheres, cylinders, etc.), the textures
      were downloaded from the internet. My sources were the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The texture used for the energy balls in the Nine Pillar
        Lightning Stage was accessed from <a
        href="http://orangepekoemedia.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/particleenergyball-ss-alleffects.png">here</a>.
      </li>
      <li>The texture used for the cloud floor of the Nine Pillar
        Stage was obtained from <a
        href="http://www.psd-dude.com/tutorials/resources-images/over-50-free-beautiful-clouds-textures-that-you-must-have/cloud--texture-3.jpg">here.</a>
        The photographer's flickr can be accessed <a
        href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dobrych/">here.</a>
      </li>
      <li>The incredible skybox used for the Nine Pillar Stage, entitled "Night Sky", was
        accessed from <a href="http://www.redsorceress.com/skybox.html">this page</a>.
        Unfortunately, I could not determine the original artist's name.
      </li>
      <li>The texture used for the floor of the Lava Death Stage
        was made by Twister10, and accessed from <a
        href="http://twister10.deviantart.com/art/Lava-texture-87252091">here</a>.
      </li>
      <li>The texture used for the lava balls and the lava pool in
        the Lava Death Stage was accessed from <a
        href="http://stemkoski.github.io/Three.js/images/lava.jpg">here</a>.
        I do not believe that Mr./Ms. Stemkoski made this texture
        himself, however, as this texture seems to be common in WebGL
        examples. I haven't been able to find authoritative information
        as to the original creator!
      </li>
      <li>The texture used for the volcano material in the Lava
        Death Stage was made by Duion, released on <a
        href="http://opengameart.org">opengameart.org</a>. <a
        href="http://opengameart.org/content/williamwall01">Here</a> is
        a direct link to the texture's page. The texture is apparently
        based on a photo by someone whom Duion only names as "Williams."
      </li>
      <li>The texture used to signify that a player character has
        been "burned" in the Lava Death Stage was made by someone named
        mad-texture, and released on his deviantart. <a
        href="http://mad-texture.deviantart.com/art/Boiled-Flesh-203355869">Here's
          a link to the page!</a>
      </li>
    </ul>

      Stage ideas and any other suggestions for making the game more
      interesting are welcome! Please direct all such suggestions to
      aaron<span class="dummy">REMOVE</span>jrubin1@<span class="dummy">REMOVE</span>gmail.com.
      Keep in mind, though, the following points.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>I have no intentions at this point of making this game
        playable over the internet. Maybe some day, when it becomes more
        convenient to run Dart on the server so I can share code between
        the client and server ends!</li>
      <li>Making shooting a player-initiated event would require
        increasing the amount of simultaneous key-presses from multiple
        players at once, so that is also off the table for the time
        being.</li>
    </ul>
