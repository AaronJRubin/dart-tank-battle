   <h1>About this Game</h1>
   <p>This is a simple tank shooting game, implemented in the Dart programming language and designed to be played by multiple players around a single keyboard.</p>
   <p>The controls were designed to minimize the amount of keys that would need to be processed simultaneously. No more than
   two keys should be pressed at the same time per player! This concern motivated my decision to make shooting automatic,
   rather than player-controlled.</p>
   <p>Most keyboards only allow for up to six key-presses to be registered at once.
   Consequently, playing this game with four players, which would require up to eight simultaneous key-presses, is not recommended
   unless you have a very high-end keyboard.</p>
   <p>Incidentally, the ability of a keyboard to handle an arbitrary number of key presses at once is called <em>n</em>-key rollover.
   Look it up if you're interested!</p>
   <p>Technologies used in this game include <a href="https://github.com/threeDart/three.dart">three.dart</a> (for the game itself), HTML5 local storage for game settings,
   and <a href="http://www.polymer-project.org/">polymer</a>, including the recently released
   <a href="http://www.polymer-project.org/docs/elements/paper-elements.html">Paper elements</a>, for various user interface elements. Because HTML5 local storage is used,
   the game settings on this page may not work on very old browsers, forcing you to play with defaults. In addition, Polymer,
   the web components technology on which it is based, and Paper elements are new technologies that may not work across all browsers, even modern ones.
   Chrome is best, Firefox is fine (a bit laggy), and Safari isn't quite there yet.</p>
   <p>While the actual models used in this game were created by me from geometric primitives (spheres, cylinders, etc.), the textures
   were downloaded from the internet. My sources were the following:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>The texture used for the energy balls in the Nine Pillar Lightning Stage was accessed
   from <a href="http://orangepekoemedia.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/particleenergyball-ss-alleffects.png">here</a>.</li>
   <li>The texture used for the cloud flour of the Nine Pillar Stage was obtained from
   <a href="http://www.psd-dude.com/tutorials/resources-images/over-50-free-beautiful-clouds-textures-that-you-must-have/cloud--texture-3.jpg">here.</a>
   The photographer's flickr can be accessed <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dobrych/">here.</a></li>
   <li>The incredible skybox used for the Nine Pillar Stage was accessed from
   <a href="http://www.redsorceress.com/skybox.html">http://www.redsorceress.com/skybox.html</a>,
   entitled "Night Sky." Unfortunately, I could not determine the original artist's name.</li>
   <li>The texture used for the floor of the Lava Death Stage was made by Twister10, and accessed from
   <a href="http://twister10.deviantart.com/art/Lava-texture-87252091">here</a>.</li>
   <li>The texture used for the lava balls and the lava pool in the Lava Death Stage was accessed from
   <a href="http://stemkoski.github.io/Three.js/images/lava.jpg">here</a>. I do not believe that
   Mr./Ms. Stemkoski made that texture himself, however, as it seems to be common in webgl examples. I haven't
   been able to find authoritative information as to the original creator!</li>
   <li>The texture used for the volcano material in the Lava Death Stage was made by Duion, released
   on <a href="http://opengameart.org">opengameart.org</a>. <a href="http://opengameart.org/content/williamwall01">Here</a> is
   a direct link to the texture's page. The texture is apparently based on a photo by someone whom Duion
   only names as "Williams."</li>
   <li>The texture used to signify that a player character has been "burned" in the Lava Death Stage
   was made by a fellow named mad-texture, and released on his deviantart.
   <a href="http://mad-texture.deviantart.com/art/Boiled-Flesh-203355869">Here's a link to the page!</a></li>
   </ul>
   <p>Suggestions for making the game more interesting and fun are welcome! Please direct all such suggestions and inquiries
   to aaron<span id="dummy">REMOVE</span>jrubin1@<span id="dummy">REMOVE</span>gmail.com. Keep in mind, though,
   the following points.</p>
   <ul>
   <li>I have no intentions at this point of making this game playable over the internet. Maybe some day,
   when it becomes more convenient to run Dart on the server so I can share code between the client and server ends!</li>
   <li>Making shooting a player-initiated event would require increasing the amount of simultaneous key-presses from
   multiple players at once, so that is also off the table for the time being.</li>
